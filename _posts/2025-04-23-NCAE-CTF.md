Recently, I competed with a couple friends in the NCAE Regional competition. While it's supposed to be both a defense and CTF competition at the same time, I was assigned to mainly work on the CTF front. We ended up getting 4th place, and got almost every CTF flag except for 2. (More like 1 missed because no team got the last one `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`).
Overall it was a really fun experience and I learned a couple of new stuff from it! Here's a mini writeup about the flags that I was able to collect or help with:

## Collected Flags:

### Security Operations
1. SOC1-4: 
	The first 4 challaneges were really just "look them up on Google"

  {% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/images/ncae-ctf/Pasted image 20250222212911.png" alt="" caption="SOC 1: SIEM" %}
  SOC 1: SIEM - `c2ctf{Security information and event management}`

  {% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/images/ncae-ctf/Pasted image 20250222213017.png" alt="" caption="SOC 2: NDR" %}
  SOC 2: NDR - `c2ctf{Network detection and response}`

  {% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/images/ncae-ctf/Pasted image 20250222213056.png" alt="" caption="SOC 3: EDR" %}
  SOC 3: EDR - `c2ctf{Endpoint Detection and Response}`

  {% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/images/ncae-ctf/Pasted image 20250222213137.png" alt="" caption="SOC 4: Zeek" %}
  SOC 4: Zeek - Tbh I mostly guessed for this one based on Zeek's release date. I think the answer was `c2ctf{1996}` or something like that

  The rest of the SOC challenges required us to look through a bunch of Corelight logs. Some of my teammates were able to get a few while I got SOC8 and SOC9. There were a few web GUIs we could pick from to filter through the logs. I mainly used Splunk and LogScale 

2. SOC 8: Answer me DNS!
  {% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/images/ncae-ctf/Pasted image 20250222213137.png" alt="" caption="SOC 8: Answer me DNS!" %}
  {% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/images/ncae-ctf/Pasted image 20250222214741.png" alt="" caption="Splunk" %}
  {% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/images/ncae-ctf/Pasted image 20250222214832.png" alt="" caption="Sus log" %}
  - `c2ctf{l.ns.ostrykebs.pl}`

3. SOC9: The Hydra Got In
  {% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/images/ncae-ctf/Pasted image 20250222214905.png" alt="" caption="SOC9: The Hydra Got In" %}
  {% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/images/ncae-ctf/Pasted image 20250222215137.png" alt="" caption="More sus logs" %}
  - For this one I kinda got a bit lucky. I ended up looking through RDP requests that had `auth_success` as true. I then started going through the ports manually from the oldest found. I believe the correct flag was `c2ctf{50482}`

We sadly didn't get the final SOC10 flag in time as that required getting a pcap file with a URL from the logs. We were really close though!

### Trivia

As you can probably imagine, this was just a "google stuff" category.

1. And The Winner Is...
  {% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/images/ncae-ctf/Pasted image 20250222215934.png" alt="" caption="And The Winner Is..." %}
  Flag: `c2ctf{Orange Tsai}`
	Source: https://portswigger.net/research/top-10-web-hacking-techniques-of-2024

2. Wolves in the Fortress
  {% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/images/ncae-ctf/Pasted image 20250222220401.png" alt="" caption="Wolves in the Fortress" %}
  Flag: `c2ctf{CVE-2024-55591}`

### Cryptography
1. Baby Block Cipher
  {% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/images/ncae-ctf/Pasted image 20250222221340.png" alt="" caption="Baby Block Cipher" %}
  This was a super fun one to work on with a teammate! We initially got a C source code file:
  ```C
	#include <stdint.h>
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <stdlib.h>
	#include <string.h>
	
	uint8_t key = 0x11;
	// TODO: implement a decryption function. Shouldn't be too hard, right?
	 
	
	void encrypt(unsigned char* plaintext) {
    unsigned char iv[8] = "18273645";
    uint8_t block_len = 8;
    uint8_t plain_len = strlen(plaintext);

    for (int i = 0; i < plain_len-3; i += block_len) {
        // step 1
        uint64_t block = 0;
        memcpy(&block, plaintext + i, block_len);
        block = (block << key | block >> (64 - key)) & 0xffffffffffffffff;
        unsigned char *temp = (char *)&block;
        memcpy(plaintext + i, &block, block_len);

        // step 2
        for (int j = 0; j < block_len; j++) {
            plaintext[i + j] ^= iv[j];
            iv[j] = plaintext[i + j];
        }
    }
	}
	
	int main() {
	    // note: this is not the flag. The flag is when you decrypt the ciphertext
	    // second note: the x's are padding and should not be submitted as part of the flag
	    unsigned char plaintext[] = "c2ctf{there's a real flag on prod}xxxxxxxx";
	    encrypt((char *)plaintext);
	    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(plaintext); i++) {
	        printf("%02x", plaintext[i]);
	    }
	}
	```

  and the we also got an encrypted file output: `f5e0f453f5def8c31530949523603ea1f5d4f2719dbc5e1f052492b545da84e5`

  This is what our decryption code looked like:
  ```C
		void decrypt(unsigned char* ciphertext) {
	    unsigned char iv[8] = "18273645";
	    uint8_t block_len = 8;
	    uint8_t cipher_len = strlen(ciphertext);
	    for (int i = 0; i < cipher_len - 3; i += block_len) {
	
	        // Step 1: Reverse XOR with IV
	        unsigned char temp_iv[8];
	        memcpy(temp_iv, ciphertext + i, block_len);
	        for (int j = 0; j < block_len; j++) {
	            ciphertext[i + j] ^= iv[j];
	            iv[j] = temp_iv[j];
	        }
	
	        // Step 2: Reverse bit rotation
	        uint64_t block = 0;
	        memcpy(&block, ciphertext + i, block_len);
	        block = (block >> key | block << (64 - key)) & 0xffffffffffffffff;
	        memcpy(ciphertext + i, &block, block_len);
	    }
	}
	```

  (we ended up stealing code from another source file they gave us to convert the hex into a character array lol)

2. Buddy Up!
  {% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/images/ncae-ctf/Pasted image 20250222221842.png" alt="" caption="Buddy Up!" %}

  This was an interesting challenge! We ended up needing to use two Kali linux VMs with me on one and a teammate on the other. The basic idea is that one person had the encrypted flag and the other got a hint for the encryption. I was on the hint side, so my partner was able to get the flag through that.

3. XOR Primer
  {% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/images/ncae-ctf/Pasted image 20250222222045.png" alt="" caption="XOR Primer" %}

  I didn't solve this one, but might as well include it... cuz yeah this was insanely easy lol.

### Networking
For these challenges, we were given a PCAP file to browse through. My teammates did the first two challenges, while I did the third:

1. The Great Lockout 3 - The Great Login Mystery
  {% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/images/ncae-ctf/Pasted image 20250222222753.png" alt="" caption="The Great Lockout 3 - The Great Login Mystery" %}

  For this one, I just follow some of the streams in Wireshark to find the `sshd_config` file that had been compromised. I wasn't sure what to look out for, so I just start copying all the lines that weren't commented until I found the flag. The answer is `c2ctf{Ciphers 3des-cbc}`

  (There is supposed to be an image here but I lost the file :sob:)

### Binary Exploitation
Saving the best for last, we have my favorite category for CTFs: Binary stuff! Sadly although we had source code for these, we had to use netcat to get the flags and I didn't take any screenshots before the VMs went down. So no flags or extra screenshots for these two.

1. Leak!:
  {% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/images/ncae-ctf/Pasted image 20250222222803.png" alt="" caption="Leak!" %}
  ```c
	#include <stdio.h>
	
	#include <stdlib.h>
	
	#include <string.h>
	
	#include <unistd.h>
	
	  
	
	__attribute__((constructor)) void flush_buf() {
	
	    setbuf(stdin, NULL);
	
	    setbuf(stdout, NULL);
	
	    setbuf(stderr, NULL);
	
	}
	
	  
	
	int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
	
	    puts("Welcome to the leak challenge!");
	
	    printf("The current memory address of puts() is %p\n", puts);
	
	    puts("What's the current memory address of system()? Provide your answer like 0x12345678");
	
	    printf("> ");
	
	  
	
	    void * buf;
	
	    scanf("%p", &buf);
	
	  
	
	    if (buf == (void *)system) {
	
	        puts("Congrats! Here is your flag:");
	
	        system("cat flag.txt");
	
	    } else {
	
	        puts("Sorry, that's not the correct address of system().");
	
	    }
	
	    return 0;
	
	}
	```

  For this one, we needed to figure out the memory address of puts, and we needed to give the memory address of system. Thankfully `libc.so` was given to us as well, so all I needed to do was open that in IDA and get the offset between the two functions, and then I could find the exact address of System() with the offset.

2. Shellcode:
  {% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/images/ncae-ctf/Pasted image 20250222222815.png" alt="" caption="Shellcode" %}
  ```C
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <stdlib.h>
	#include <string.h>
	#include <unistd.h>
	#include <sys/mman.h>
	
	__attribute__((constructor)) void flush_buf() {
	    setbuf(stdin, NULL);
	    setbuf(stdout, NULL);
	    setbuf(stderr, NULL);
	}
	
	int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
	    // create RWE segment to store code
	    void* code = mmap(0, 0x1000, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
	
	    // read shellcode
	    char buf[0x40];
	    char tmp_buf[0x80];
	    printf("Provide your shellcode (ASCII hex bytes like 2f4a5568): ");
	
    int r = read(0, tmp_buf, sizeof(tmp_buf));
	
	    // convert ASCII hex to binary
	    for (int i = 0; i < r; i += 2) {
	        sscanf(tmp_buf + i, "%2hhx", buf + (i / 2));
	    }
	
	    // copy shellcode to RWE segment
	    memcpy(code, buf, r);
	
	    // execute shellcode
	    ((void (*)())code)();
	
	    return 0;
	}
	```

  I will admit. This one took me WAAAAY longer than it really should have for me. Originally I thought that I need to find shellcode on the internet that would open the file and print the contents to the console, but it turns out you can just get access to bash shell with shellcode! I didn't even know this was possible until this challenge. Once I got access to shell, I could just print the flag.txt using cat.
