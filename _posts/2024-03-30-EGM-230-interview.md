# Afterthoughts: The World Ends with You
This quirky DS adventure may lack the cachet of Square Enix's other role-playing greats, but World feels far hipper than any recent Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy. We asked Tatsuya Kando, the game's director, about developing this fashion-forward quest.

**EGM: Did you consider trying to remove all of the game's overt references to Tokyo in order to make it more appealing and culturally relevant to Americans?**
**Tatsuya Kando:** We wanted North American users to realize that a city exactly like the one in the game actually exists on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, thus helping the setting feel more real and adding increased depth to the in-game world. Because of this approach, we realize that some Western players may experience a cultural gap. However, we believed that by showing those players what types of fashion or music are popular in Shibuya [a ward in Tokyo], as well as giving some insight into the minds of the Japanese youth, they would begin to show further interest in Japan and its culture. We wanted to make a game that would help players from around the world feel closer to their gaming counterparts in Japan and thus increase their interest in the country. Once players have completed the game, it would be wonderful if they could come to Japan, DS in hand, and explore the real Shibuya.

**EGM:** Is it actually possible to play effectively while controlling both characters? We get headaches if we don't use autobattle for the upper screen.
TK: Players should first concentrate on becoming comfortable with the lower-screen controls. Once they feel [that] they have a grasp of them, they can try their hands at the upper-screen controls. By keeping an eye on both screens and the balls of light that appear with the finishing moves, players can further improve their efficiency.

**EGM:** World reminds us of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memoriesâ€”replace the pins with cards and you're halfway there. Is there a deeper connection? Did World evolve from Chain, and if so, how?
**TK:** Because the development teams were almost the same, some aspects of the two games, such as their logic systems, have similarities. However, when developing the overall gameplay of World, we tried to forget what we had done in the past and start fresh. We believe that we were able to construct an optimal system combining real-time action battles and stylus input.

**EGM:** You created a lot of cool in-game fashions (pins, clothes, etc.). So how long will it be before we see Square Enix designs on a fashion runway?
**TK:** If enough users expressed interest in bringing those designs into the real world, and the pins and characters from World could successfully make that transition from the game world to the real world, events such as fashion shows, and more, may be conceivable. It would be exciting if something like this could be realized.
