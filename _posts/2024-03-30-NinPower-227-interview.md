# BRAVE NEW WORLD
While working as the animation director of the Kingdom Hearts series, Tatsuya Kando earned the trust of Kingdom Hearts creator Tetsuya Nomura, who asked Mr. Kando to direct The World Ends with You. When contacted by Nintendo Power, Mr. Kando was kind enough to answer a few questions about his directorial debut.

**Nintendo Power: How long was The World Ends with You in development? We've heard that it was an unusually long development cycle.**
**Tatsuya Kando:** The entire development process took around two and a half years, since we had been considering many new ideas from before the release of the Nintendo DS. The first six months saw endless meetings as the three of us drafted and redrafted the project plan, and another six months were spent reviewing the plans with Jupiter. There were many ideas that didn't make it, and the system underwent several drastic changes. In the end, I think that this was time well spent, considering the variety of complex elements that are now seamlessly intertwined in the completed product.

**I understand your development team has a lot of staff in common with the Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories team. Were any of the ideas in The World Ends with You originally considered for the Kingdom Hearts series?**
There aren't any ideas that had originally been planned for Kingdom Hearts, per se. Since the Nintendo DS hardware is very different in nature from what we had worked with in the past, we were asked to put forth concepts and ideas that were very DS-specific. In fact, one of our objectives during development was to create something completely new—something none of us had made before—so I think that the world, scenario, gameplay, and graphics, among a variety of other elements in this game, are very unique. Challenging ourselves in this way was, of course, possible because we had the experience and skills gained from working on titles like Kingdom Hearts.

**How was the original idea for the game conceived? What was Mr. Nomura's involvement with the game?**
The ideas came together during development, mainly through brainstorm sessions. We were able to think freely, sans the restrictions that might have been placed on our ideas in a title of a larger scope. What we had decided in the earliest stages was that the dual screen would be used simultaneously in battle, and that the story would take place in modern-day Tokyo. Continuously exchanging ideas through brainstorm sessions, the core staff members were able to work steadily toward our goal of providing fresh concepts and content with complexity, ultimately creating a game that would be fun to play. Nomura gave us stimulating feedback from the creative producer's vantage point throughout the development process.

**The World Ends with You has a wonderful soundtrack. Why did you decide to use primarily vocal tracks? Where did you find so many different vocalists?**
Since the game takes place in modern-day Shibuya, I had asked our composer, Takeharu Ishimoto, to come up with various types of music that one might actually hear when walking through the streets of Shibuya. That was about the extent of my direction, and the rest was left up to him, so when I heard samples of his music for the first time I was surprised to find that it had vocals—something I hadn't anticipated at all for battle music of a DS title. But I told him to move forward with it. I was sure that users would be surprised with these tracks, just as I had been. Some of the battle music in the Japanese release doesn't have vocals, but the North American release will include brand-new tracks with even more vocals. The Japanese fans might be envious. The singers are either friends of Ishimoto's, or artists that he discovered and sought out for this project.

**Why is there so much English-language music in a game set in Japan? Will the few Japanese-vocal tracks be preserved for the North American version?**
That probably has to do with Ishimoto's style. English songs are very popular in Japan, and I think that understanding the language isn't the most important part of enjoying music. Some people are satisfied if they can simply listen to good music, and even feel that certain words sound "cooler" when pronounced in English. When it came to music, our decisions were made based on whether a track sounded cool or not, and there was never a rule that the songs had to be in Japanese. I think this is something that really sets The World Ends with You apart from other titles, as we never limited ourselves to creating “game music" when it came to the soundtrack. The North American release will definitely have Japanese songs! It would be great to hear what you think of them!

**Why did you decide to set your game specifically in Shibuya? Is there anything about the area that you feel Americans should know in order to fully appreciate the game?**
The main reason is that the members of the development team reside in Japan, and in this country Shibuya is very symbolic as the center of youth culture. Shibuya was the most suitable place, in our minds, as the setting for our 15-year-old characters to embark on their adventure. Many of our North American users will probably not be familiar with Shibuya, but in playing The World Ends with you they will be able to experience Shibuya vicariously through the main character, Neku. The map included in this game is actually almost identical to the Shibuya in real life. If you have the opportunity to visit Japan after playing this game, you might even be able to use The World Ends with you as your guide through the streets of Shibuya, and might even fall under the illusion that you've actually become Neku.

**The title "The World Ends with You" is really catchy, but quite a bit darker than the Japanese title, It's a Wonderful World. What is it a reference to?**
Although the Japanese and English titles are expressed in different words, the fundamental message is the same. We wanted a title that would suit a story that depicts the growth and development of our protagonist, Neku. We hope that this title will provide insight on the various themes that are present in this game: the bond between people, different forms of communication, and how the young characters will seek answers to the experiences they will be facing. 

**What was the inspiration for The World Ends with You's unique battle system? Have you been pleased with the reaction of players?**
At our meetings, we tried to come up with many ideas that were unheard of—things that no one else would think of and the dual-screen battle system was one such idea. I'm sure this concept was considered in theory at some point, but no one probably thought to make it happen. In reality it took a considerable amount of time to make this concept function as a game, but I think we were able to create something special and unique as a result. The action on the bottom screen is especially intriguing, because it makes use of the DS touch screen to its fullest for an intense battle experience. Players can unleash an extensive variety of psychic abilities by simple movements of the stylus. I think this is one of the most exhilarating and enjoyable aspects of this game. Among our Japanese users there are those that have been playing for tens of hours. From the developer's point of view, we are very pleased that we were able to create something that players can immerse themselves in.

**The World Ends with You is the only game I know of that has separate action scenes unfolding on both screens of the Nintendo DS. Was implementing that a programming challenge?**
Since these battles make full use of the DS hardware's potential, as you can imagine we maximized its programming to a point where it would be impossible to implement anything more. During battle, players can control everything from the characters, enemies and psychic abilities, to objects in the background, and all this control is doubled because of the way we've used the dual screens. On top of everything we have a system linking the actions taking place in the top and bottom screens, so there were definitely many things that the programmer had to manage. We had him working extra hard to put it all together. I think it must have been like working on two individual games at once.

**Games that are as original as The World Ends with You are exceptionally rare. Do you attribute that to a lack of original ideas among developers, or the difficulty of marketing original ideas?**
I don't think there's ever a lack of ideas. If we run out of ideas we're out of a job. New ideas are hidden all over the place, taking many different shapes and forms. I have to admit it's a difficult process to find them, but at the same time it is very fun and satisfying when I do. Users today have a very good eye when it comes to figuring out which games are worth their time. No one wants to be the first in line to purchase a boring game. I am sure that users feel a certain risk when buying a new IP, as they don't offer the security that an established title does. I think it's our responsibility as developers to constantly provide entertaining gaming experiences so that users don't have to worry about quality when purchasing a game. 

**What was the inspiration for the difficulty slider? It strikes me as a great idea—any hope that we might see that make the jump to the Kingdom Hearts or Final Fantasy franchises one day?**
There are many difficult RPG titles in Japan, and many users give up before seeing the ending. Everyone who buys a game should be able to see the ending!! That is the development team's wish—and it was our goal from the start to create a game where anyone would be able to reach the ending without getting bored or annoyed. Simply making it easy would be disappointing to core gamers, so we created a system in which raising the difficulty level increases the reward. The difficulty level can be adjusted in any situation, and while there is no penalty for lowering it, when it is raised players are rewarded with items of an appropriate value, so everyone can play at their own pace. This system was very well received internally as well, so I am sure that a similar concept will be implemented for other projects. I am pretty sure that games that I direct in the future will have a similar system. 

**What were you hoping to accomplish by allowing players to level up their skills by shutting off the game for long periods of time?**
If you become bored with a game half way through and put it down to take a break, you might not feel like getting back into it in a few days' time. But what if your BP level increased during the time you'd been away from the game? If you're a little stronger than before, you might be able to advance with renewed strength! This was the thought process we were hoping to encourage with this system. This is also part of the wish that was discussed earlier, to have as many users as possible reach the ending.

**During development, did you consider multiplayer options, such as dividing up the combat screens, or allowing players to duel each other with their custom decks?**
We definitely considered multiplayer options, but as we moved farther along in development we decided to scratch the entire idea. Our primary concern was to make the single-player experience a well-rounded one; otherwise we felt that players wouldn't be able to fully enjoy the game. Working on this title was definitely a learning experience, and looking back I can now see things I wasn't able to in the midst of development. This newfound knowledge might be reflected in a follow-up title if there is an opportunity for one.

**Have you been satisfied with the reactions of fans to the game in Japan? Would you like to pursue another original IP for your next project, or work with an established franchise like Kingdom Hearts again?**
Since this was a new IP, we did have our worries until it was completed. Fortunately, it was very well-received by Japanese users, and the development team has happily heaved a big sigh of relief. There have been requests for a sequel as well, so we hope to be able to answer to that some day. I am currently involved in the development of Final Fantasy Versus XIII, but working on an original IP was definitely a very exciting and stimulating experience, so I would love to take on the challenge again in the future.
